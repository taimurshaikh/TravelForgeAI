The interior\u2014red booths, mahogany, polished brass railings\u2014has changed little since the Art Deco period, but anyone who is anyone knows that the best seats in the house are actually out on the sidewalk (and thankfully the famous terrasse is open at full capacity again), where the people watching can't be beat and the city's caf\u00e9 iconic culture is at its finest. Located within the Cit\u00e9 de la Musique complex in the Parc de la Villette, in the underexplored 19th arrondissement, the building breaks with all the design conventions of traditional symphony halls, instead favoring pod-like boxes inside the theater, a stage in the round, and a complex, undulating metal fa\u00e7ade.\n The layout of the building has been redesigned, highlighting the beauty of the mid-16th century mansions as much as helping you to discover the paleolithic origins of the city through the present with 3,800 works now on display.
