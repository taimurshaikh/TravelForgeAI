Artistic treasures are found throughout the gardens, such as the picturesque 17th-century Fontaine M\u00e9dicis, a fountain basin nestled under trees opposite the east front of the Palais du Luxembourg, which today is used by the French state as the seat of the Senate.\n Currently, the interior of the cathedral (including the towers) and the space immediately in front of the cathedral (on the Parvis Notre-Dame) are closed to the public.",
